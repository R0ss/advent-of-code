You are provided with a list of strings of varying lengths.

Encoding Algorithm: 
                "a" to "z" correspond to ints 1 to 26 respectively
                "A" to "Z" correspond to ints 27 to 52 respectively

Part 1: For each line, split the string into 2 equal halves and find the character 
        that appears in both halves (these are the "duplicate characters"). Next,
        encode all of the "duplicate characters" into integers (using the encoding algorithm),
        then figure out the sum of those numbers.

Part 2: Group the first three lines together. Identify the common character among them.
        Repeat this process for all of the lines (i.e. grouping them and finding the
        common character). Next take all of the common characters and encode them into
        integers (using the encoding algorithm), then figure out the sum of those numbers.
