Your input includes an initial state of a series of columns numbered 1 to 9. 
Within each column is a stack of letters. Each item in the stack has the following 
form: [X]. Each column can have a stack of arbitrary height, and the letters can 
appear multiple times.

Below the "initial state" diagram is a set of instructions for moving items from
one column to the next. The instructions have a consistent format of: "move 1 from
2 to 3", where "1" is the number of items, and "2"/"3" are the origin/destination
columns. You must apply all of the instructions in order to the initial state of the
columns in order to get the end state.

Part 1: Move the items one at a time from one column to the next

Part 2: Move all of the items from one column to the next in one step
