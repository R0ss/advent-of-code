You are provided with a list of strings representing a game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors".
Each line represents one round of the game. The game is scored after each round.
A line includes 2 space-delimited characters. The first character is the opponent's
move, where "A" is "rock", "B" is "paper", and "Z" is scissors. The second character,
can be "X", "Y", or "Z". The meaning of the second character changes in part 1 and part 2
of the puzzle.

Scoring: Winning a round is 6 points, a draw is 3 points, a loss is 0. 
Playing "rock", "paper, or "scissors" awards the player 1, 2, or 3 points respectively.

Part 1: Calculate the total score when "X", "Y", and "Z" have the same meaning as "A", "B", and "C".

Part 2: Calculate the total score when "X", "Y", and "Z" are the outcomes of the round (for the player).
        Where "X", "Y", and "Z" correspond to a player "losing", "drawing", or "winning" the round,
        given the opponent's move for that round.
