Your input is a history of terminal commands for traversing and inspecting
a set of directories and files. The history can include the following commands:

"$ cd ..": Going to the parent directory
"$ ls": Listing the files and directories in the current folder
"$ cd pcqjncwl": Going to one of the directories (called "pcqjncwl"),
                 which exists within the current directory

Note: When "$ ls" is called, the following files and folders (respectively)
      will be listed in the following format:
      
      "65156 bfmt.zcb": Where the file size ("65156") and filename ("bfmt.zcb")
                        are presented with a space delimiter
      "dir nsq": Where the subfolder name ("nsq") is presented after: "dir "

Part 1: Identify all of the directories with contents whose sizes add up to
        at most 100,000. Then add up the sizes of all of the directories found.
        The solution can end up counting the same files multiple times across
        directories.

Part 2: Suppose that you want to create a new memory partition of 30,000,000.
        Assuming that you have a max size of 70,000,000, figure out how much
        space you need to free up in order to have enough space for the partition.
        Then find the smallest directory that can be deleted in order to increase
        the available space to 30,000,000.
